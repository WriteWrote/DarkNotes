# DarkNotes

This is a simple text-redactor (WIP), which I decided to create after I tired of white light of Word. It's a slowly-build project, but I still hope to manage it.

*List of the features ToDo:*
- Changing transparency (default 95%)
- sizing of workspace
- saving and loading files (oooh I expect here problems w/ encoding)
- it would be nice to have versioning while you write
- changing fonts, sizes of letters
- make a "red-line"
- make a nice borders
- the *actual Task&Instrument Board*!
- maaaybe it future-future - nice background
- also "maaaybe" - music background
- changing dark-mode to light-mode
- customizing mode

# Bugs

- When window changes from "fill the screen" mode to "small" mode the opacity changes to full 100%, then goes to 95%
- Don't get feature w/ transparency
- It may be hard, but I need to check if transparency of the form also makes text transparent (of course it makes!) and how to deal w/ it if it's possible
