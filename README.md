# DarkNotes

This is a simple text-redactor (WIP), which I decided to create after I tired of white light of Word. It's a slowly-build project, but I still hope to manage it.

***List of the features ToDo:***
- Changing transparency (default 95%)
- sizing of workspace
- saving and loading files (oooh I expect here problems w/ encoding)
- it would be nice to have versioning while you write
- changing fonts, sizes of letters
- make a "red-line"
- make a nice borders
- the ***actual Task&Instrument Board***!
- maaaybe it future-future - nice background
- also "maaaybe" - music background
